        	<p>This section is where I've put the stories I've written.  Most of them are romance-ish but I tried to branch ou a little.  The horror story <em>Father's Love</em> is my particular favourite.  This is the one I show people when they ask to see a sample of my writing.</p>
            <p><em><a href="fatherslove.html">Father's Love</a></em> - Maxwell Cifer's adoptive father has escaped from prison and returned to wreak havoc on Maxwell's friends. </p>
            <p><em><a href="fixingadam.html">Fixing Adam</a></em> - Amy can't deal with her twin brother's self destructive habits anymore.</p><p><em><a href="shift.html">Shift</a></em> - Ryuuchi is an outcast among outcasts but as long as Kamitani is there with him, he might be okay.</p>
            <p><em><a href="bloodandchocolate.html">Blood and Chocolate</a></em> - Suguro has unknowningly stumbled upon a nest of demons when all he wanted was a date with a pair of bright blue eyes.</p>
