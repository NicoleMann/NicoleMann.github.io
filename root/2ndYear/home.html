        	<p>I write a lot in my spare time.  It's relaxing for me when I'm stressed out.  This is a collection of some of the better pieces I've written over the years.</p>
            <p>I do not claim that any of it is actually any good, but they are some of my favourites.  Some of them I wrote in under an hour, others took me several weeks.  One particular story was written in 48 straight hours.  It was beautiful and I regret nothing.</p>
