        	<h3>Twins</h3>
            <p>The One and the Other are twins</p>
            <p>Identical, interchangeable</p>
            <p>Only one legitimate difference</p>
            <p>One hurts, Other heals. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Because One has the evil of One and Other</p>
            <p>And Other has the good of Other and One</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Never approach One by himself</p>
            <p>You would never escape unharmed</p>
            <p>Such an encounter would turn disastrous</p>
            <p>For those prone to nightmares. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Because One has the evil of One and Other</p>
            <p>And Other has the good of Other and One</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Other always distracts One</p>
            <p>Takes the bullying on himself</p>
            <p>Never snaps, never fights back</p>
            <p>Never even gets angry</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Because One has the evil of One and Other</p>
            <p>And Other has the good of Other and One</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Two sides of the exact same coin</p>
            <p>Mirror image and yet reversed</p>
            <p>One and Other, Other and One</p>
            <p>Only two, 'cause it's that or none.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>The Faces He Shows </h3>
            <p>Tall and thick </p>
            <p>Eyes dark and brooding</p>
            <p>Lips firmly frowning </p>
            <p>A brute? </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Bloody knuckles </p>
            <p>A dark back alley </p>
            <p>Alcohol on his breath </p>
            <p>A drunk? </p>
            <p>Mental contradictions </p>
            <p>Backwards words </p>
            <p>Actions upside down </p>
            <p>A head case? </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Does what he has to </p>
            <p>Looks out for his own </p>
            <p>Accepts her as is </p>
            <p>A heart of gold. </p>
