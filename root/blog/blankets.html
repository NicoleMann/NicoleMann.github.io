            <p>As I've said, the first real project that I ever did was a blanket.  The pattern was super easy, but this was before I knew what 'tension' was :P</p>

		<p>30 NOV 2016 - The first afghan I did was blue and white.  I realized after I bought the yarn that I had accidentally picked the colours of my high school, which I had just started.  When you look at it, you can tell where I started, and where I finished.  The pattern makes up a strip, and 5 strips make the blanket.  Each strip is about 60-something stitches and the pattern goes like this:</p><p>Row 1 (right side): K2, P2 to end.</p><p>Row 2 (wrong side): </p>
