            <p>So, as I've said, my current project is an afghan made up 3 different coloured squares, 5x5.  I have this huge box of yarn in a closet, and the other day I finished up a previous project (a set of dolls) and just raided the box, looking for my next piece.  I found this really simple pattern and nine different colours of yarn.  Each square is a different colour scheme made from 2 shades of one colour and a contrasting colour.  I'm really just trying to use up excess yarn that I have around, so we'll see how it goes.</p>

        <div id="main-block">
            <p><strong>24-OCT-2016</strong>So the pattern itself is super simple, it's garter stitch, which means it's just straight knitting.  Well, it means straight knitting for any normal knitter.  I'm mildly ambidexterous, so when I was learning, I kinda mixed myself up.  As a result, I don't turn my knitting the way everybody else does, I invert my wrong side rows.  In the case of garter stitch patterns, where everybody would knit on the wrong side rows, I purl on the right side rows.  I know that's kinda confusing, so I'll try to keep my explanations clear.</p><p>With that out of the way, back to my project.  When everything is said and done, the arrangement of the squares will look something like this:</p><img src="img/layout.jpg" alt="My Pattern" /><p>So my Square A alternates between 2 rows of dark purple, lilac, and red.</p><p>*PICS OF YARN BALLS*</p><p>Each square is 44 stitches wide, and I'm repeating the colour scheme (purple, lilac, red) 12 times. 12 repeats x 6 rows = 72 rows total per square.</p><p>*PICS OF SQUARES, IN PROGRESS AND COMPLETED*</p><p>All told, I'll need nine of these squares.</p>
